# Prototype 

[Prototype-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) and prototypal inheritance are very important concepts to learn in JavaScript programming language. It is very similar to object-oriented programming model where you can inherit the functions and properties of the parent class. JavaScript did not have class-based inheritance until the introduction of ES6 ([6th Edition - ECMAScript 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2015)). Objects in javascript are mutable, so it allows its properties to be modified or reassigned. An important idea about the prototype is the prototype chain. An object or a function initially points to its default prototype. 

Let's look at a basic example. When you create an object `car` using the `{}` notation. In the diagram below, when we created an object, it has by default inherited the methods (behaviors or functions) and properties of the Prototype Object. The magic is happening through `__proto__` property which appeared in the object. We did not add it while creating. It was attached by the prototypal feature of the language.

Let's see if we can invoke or call those functions against our object which is the `car`.

```javascript
// lets create the car object
let car = {
    make: 'Audi',
    model: 'A8',
    wheels: 4
}

console.log(car.toString()) 
// [out] "[object Object]"

console.log(car.valueOf()) 
// [out] {make: "Audi", model: "A8", wheels: 4}

```

As you can see in the code snippet above, we have not created those functions but they were inherited by the car object from `Object`. What we understand from this is that any object or function can look for values or methods which are defined in `__proto__`

Let us take another example. This time we will create a constructor function `Person` and attach additional methods to the prototype to add additional features.

```javascript
// Prototypes are an extension for objects in javascript
// we use to encapsulate certain functionality to an Object (like a Class)

// first create an Object Person
// that receive the name and lastName

function Person (firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

// We user the prototype keyword to add some functionality to this Person Object

// add a method getName that return the name
Person.prototype.getName = function () {
  return this.firstName;
};

// add a method getLastName that return the lastName
Person.prototype.getLastName = function () {
  return this.lastName;
};

// add a method getFullName that return the name + lastName
Person.prototype.getFullName = function () {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};

// add a method getFormalName
Person.prototype.getFormalName = function () {
  return this.lastName + ", " + this.firstName;
};

// these methods appear in the __proto__ property 
// of an Object instance of Person

const max = new Person("Max", "Payne");

console.log(max.getName());
// [out] Max

console.log(max.getLastName());
// [out] Payne

console.log(max.getFullName());
// [out] Max Payne

console.log(max.getFormalName());
// [out] Payne, Max
```

Now you may be a little confused with the above example. We are introducing another piece to the puzzle, `prototype` property. In the above example, the function `Person` (also known as constructor function as it returns an object) gets to be the prototype of the object `max`. When you add additional functions to the prototype, they apply to the object `max` as well.

The diagram above shows that `max` has a `__proto__` which is pointing to the `prototype` of `Person`. Let's see if it matches.

Looks similar, let us compare. Enter following code in the console (only after you have already executed the Person and max related code snippet above)

```javascript
max.__proto__ === Person.prototype
// [out] true
``` 

And guess what? the chain does not end there, `Person.prototype` has a property `__proto__` which now points to `Object`.
