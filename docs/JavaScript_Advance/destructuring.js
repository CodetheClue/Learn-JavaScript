// As data coming from the server is very big then there is better way of getting the data out of object

const a = { // Suppose this is the object coming from server then
  name: "Swapnil",
  age: 19,
  college: "SIES"
};

// By using Destructuring we can get the data of specific keys out into variables

const { name, age, college } = a; // This way name variable gets "Swapnil" this is possible because the object also has same key

console.log(name); // Output Swapnil

const { name: Myname } = a; // This way Myname variable get assigned the value of name key in from object a

console.log(Myname); // Output Swapnil

array = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // Array Declaration

const [first, second, , fourth] = array; // Array Destructuring

// In this the Order of variables matters the most as arrays don't have keys

// For skipping some values we can do that using as shown here we have skipped the third value
console.log(fourth); // Output 4

newArray = ["Swapnil", 19, "Shinde"]; // New array

const [firstName, , lastName] = newArray; // Destructured the firstName and lastName

console.log(`My name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`);// Output My name is Swapnil Shinde
