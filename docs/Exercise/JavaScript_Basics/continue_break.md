### Continue Exercise
1. **Sets** a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).
2. **Make** the loop continue when i is 2 and 7
3. **Sum** after the condition of the continue, add the value of the "i" into a 
accumulator variable called sum
4. **Print** the final value of var sum

    **Expected Output**:
    19

    Reference loop
    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i <= 7; i++) {}
    ```

### Break Exercise
1. **Sets** a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).
2. **Sum** before the condition of the break, add the value of the "i" into a accumulator variable called sum
3. **Make** the loop break when i is 3
4. **Print** the final value of var sum

    **Expected Output**:
    6

    Reference loop
    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i <= 7; i++) {}
    ```
