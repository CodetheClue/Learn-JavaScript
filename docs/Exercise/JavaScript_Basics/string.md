### String Operations Exercises

**1. Write a JavaScript function to convert a string in abbreviated form.** 

Example of call of the function

**Example**
Test Data :
```js
console.log(abbrev_name("Musa Bajwa"));
```
Example Output:- 
"Musa B."

2. **Write** a JavaScript function to concatenates a given string n times (default is 1).

**Example**
Test Data :
console.log(repeat('Lol!'));
console.log(repeat('Lol!',2));
console.log(repeat('Lol!',3));
"Lol!"
"Lol!Lol!"
"Lol!Lol!Lol!"

3. **Write** a JavaScript function to strip leading and trailing spaces from a string.

**Example**

Test Data :
console.log(strip('cool '));
console.log(strip(' cool'));
console.log(strip(' cool '));
Output :
"cool"
"cool"
"cool"

4. Write a Java program to get the character at the given index within the String. 

Sample Output:

Original String = Java Exercises!                                                                             
The character at position 0 is J                                                                              
The character at position 10 is i 

5. Write a Java program to get the character (Unicode code point) at the given index within the String. 

Sample Output:

Original String : w3resource.com                                                                              
Character(unicode point) = 51                                                                                 
Character(unicode point) = 101 

6. Write a java program to compare two strings lexicographically. 

Sample Output:

String 1: This is Exercise 1                                                                                  
String 2: This is Exercise 2                                                                                  
"This is Exercise 1" is less than "This is Exercise 2"

7. Write a Java program to test if a given string contains the specified sequence of char values.

Sample Output:

Original String: PHP Exercises and Python Exercises                                                           
Specified sequence of char values: and                                                                        
true 

8. Write a Java program to compare a given string to another string, ignoring case considerations.

Sample Output:

"Stephen Edwin King" equals "Walter Winchell"? false                                                          
"Stephen Edwin King" equals "stephen edwin king"? true 

9. Write a Java program to get the canonical representation of the string object.

Sample Output:

str1 == str2? false                                                                                           
str1 == str3? true

10. Write a Java program to find whether a region in the current string matches a region in another string.
Sample Output:

str1[0 - 7] == str2[28 - 35]? true                                                                            
str1[9 - 15] == str2[9 - 15]? false
