# Anagram

given two strings as parameters, check whether you can make the first string into the second string. Assume the two strings have equal length

# Example 1

String1 = 'team'
String2 = 'mate'

should return return true because you can rearrange team to make mate

# Example 2

String1 = 'angered'
String2 = 'enraged'

Returns true

# Example 3
String1 = 'evils'
String2 = 'vile'

return false since the length of two strings are not equal
